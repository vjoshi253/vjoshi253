### About

üî≠ I'm passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I have worked in the fields of 
Artificial Intelligence for Public Health, Person Re-identification and Computer Vision for Automated Driving.

üí≠ My personal mission is to build AI-based solutions that solve a high-impact problem for people around the globe and simplify everyday living.

### Bio

üß† I am currently working as a Automated Driving Engineer at MathWorks. My primary day-to-day work includes making Automated Driving Reference Applications using both
real and simulated data. This includes working on several interesting and challenging vision problems such lane marking detections in various road conditions, 
pedestrian detection in different enviornments etc. 

‚åõÔ∏è Previously, I have worked as Gradute Student Researcher at TavLab (IIIT Delhi) and Visual Conception Group (IIIT Delhi). As a student researcher at these labs I worked on several 
projects ranging from usage of Prbabilistic Graphic Model for Explainable HIV interventions in Female Sex Workers, Agent Based Modelling to study COVID trends to Active 
Learning for Person Re-identification models. 

üéì I received my Masters in Computer Sciene and Engineering from Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT-Delhi) where my major focus area of 
Artificial Intelligence.
